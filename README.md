A web client interface for the Archangel DLT p-o-c.

There are two parts:
* Simple query and upload single-page webapp.  This is written in JavaScript using React.
* A tiny backend, throwing a minimal web API around the National Archive's
[DROID](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/policy-process/digital-continuity/file-profiling-tool-droid/)
tool.  The front end uploads files to the back, which runs them through DROID and returns the DROID profile as JSON.
The backend is built in Groovy, using Ratpack.
