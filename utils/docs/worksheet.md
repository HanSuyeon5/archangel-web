# ArchangelDLT Demo Web Application

The demo web application lets you search the blockchain for document
records, and to upload your own records.

Document records contain the document hash, some file metadata including 
file size and type, the last modified time, and some optional free text. 

## Searching 

Try searching for existing records - experiment with common file extensions
like jpg, pdf, or zip.

## Upload

Upload some files - there are a selection of zip files available 
in H:\ResearchData or you can use some of your own.

When you select a file it is first sent to DROID for characterisation.  This 
can take a few moments, so it may be several seconds before the file information
is displayed.  You can then add any additional comments, before clicking 
the Upload button to submit the file data to the blockchain.

(A small confirmation box might appear at this point - 
 just click the green _Submit_ button)

To save the uploaded information to the blockchain takes around 45 seconds.  
You can wait for a confirmation message, or you can get on with uploading 
another file or switch back to the search tab.

## Explore

Can you find the file information you uploaded?

What happens if you upload the same file information twice?

How are zip and tar files recorded?

If a file is renamed and uploaded, what do you expect will happen?  Does it?
